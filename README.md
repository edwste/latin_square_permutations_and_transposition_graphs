# Latin square permutations and transposition graphs
This program explores the solving of latin squares via permutations and graphs.   This program enumerates all the permutations that fail to intersect with the identity permutation, then uses a depth first search algorithm to create a graph linking these permutations as nodes via single transpositions as edges.  It performs a node edge count, a partite check, then displays the graph via networkx.
